Well, today is my 5 days since I start to do analysis of our company product related to Openstack. It is really so tough to do this work,
massive information sourcing, try to understand information I got, find right data basis, data selection and acquisition, make analysis of 
massive data, and most difficult and complicated work, think of criterias and dimensions with methamatical thinking and write functions to carry out analysis.
These two requires methematical preparation and developer's experience, which I got almost few unfortunately...
But after 5 days, I came up a analysis of 5 pages of excel with numbers that are beatifully run by my functions and under my dimensions.
Maybe this is easy work for most of you guys here, but I suffered 5days almost doing this except sleeping and eating, and I still continue to 
eat medicine everyday to stop my pain from knees that is caused by gout 5 days ago.
I admire myself and I believe everybody will get shocked by what I have done to this small topic but so seriously preprared with accurate
data analysis.

In the end, through this journey, I wanna thank my boss to let me open a new door to this community, I found it soo coool,and I start to love
the community I think...See u tmr, planet. I like to write something here though I don't know how to code. It is really doesn't matter.:)

Have a good night

Andrew
